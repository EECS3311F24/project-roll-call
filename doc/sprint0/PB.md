# ROLLCALL PRODUCT BACKLOG

1. As Sara(student), I want to sync my Google Calendar so that all my events automatically populate in the app, as Google Calendar is where a store all my deadlines.

2. As Alex(manager), I want to create an account and log in so that I can securely access my personalized settings and data.

3. As Alex(manager), I want an easy-to-read summary of my day that includes key meeting times and details, because each day I have many meetings and I want a concise summary them.

4. As Sara(student),  I want an easy-to-read summary of my week that highlights my classes, assessments, and due dates because I have constant deadlines throughout the week and want to be reminded so I do not miss any.

5. As Rachel(parent), I want a “Future at a glance” feature that highlights my further reaching events because my children have appointments which are planned weeks in advance and they always sneak up on me.

6. As Sara(student), I want a “Suggested TODO list” that automatically generates based on my scheduled events, helping me prioritize my tasks for the day.

7. As Rachel(parent), I want a tutorial when I first start using a new application as I am not tech savvy and I want to maximize the tools I use. 

8. As Alex(manager), I want to be emailed my report (notification feature) because I already start my day with checking my inbox and having my report in my inbox saves me time + I do not need to remember to open RollCall.

9. As Sara(student), I want to be able to share my report with my partner because I am very busy and it is easier to plan time to spend together if my schedule is clearly outlined without me having to explain when I am available. 

10. As Rachel(parent), I want to be displayed a word of the day because it is a fun feature which will motivate me to check RollCall everyday and I get to share with my kids. 

11. As Alex(manager), I want to be displayed a motivational quote because my job is high stress and it will remind me to stay focused and be a good leader.

12. As Sara(student), I want see my monthly insights because it is rewarding to see all the things I have accomplished while also making sure I am leaving enough time for my hobbies so I do not get burnt out. 

13. As Sara(student), I want to be able to sync my reports with members of research team so RollCall can automatically suggest meeting times when we are all available. 

14. As Alex(manager), I want to be able to toggle between dark and light mode because on my personal PC I use dark mode, but my work PC I use light mode. 

15. As Sara(student), I want to customize my "key" words so that I do not have to think about priority every time I add an event to my calendar. Instead I know "workout"=low,"class"=medium, "due"=high.

16. As Rachel(parent), I want to customize my "future at a glance" timeline because the default setting of 1 month is too short for me. I like to be reminded of events far in the future if they are very important. 

17. As Alex(manager), I like to customize the background because I am more excited to use applications which look the way I like them to.

18. As Sara(student), I like to be able to check off items from my TODO list becuase it satisfying and motivating. 

19. As Rachel(parent), I want to be able to look back at my previous reports because my memory is not good and if I need to remember an specific day I can look back on what I was doing. 

20. As Rachel(parent), I want to see a fun animation when I complete an item on my TODO list because it is the small things in life that bring me joy.

21. As Sara(manager), I like to have a streak tracker because I know that this tool is only effective if open it everyday and keeping a streak going is motivational for me.
