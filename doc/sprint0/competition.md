## Specific Target Users/User Scenarios for our App

**People who want a very simple, low maintenance app that shows them their schedule in an easily digestible way.**

**People who like having prioritized tasks in a visual format to follow throughout their day, with a nice task suggestion feature based on those priorities.**

**People who want to easily match schedules with another person without much effort at all.**

**People who want information about how they use their calendar, via daily/weekly/monthly reports.**

#### The competitors may not have focused on these particular users/user scenarios because: 
- They may have felt that they were "extra" features that would not be used
- They may have assumed that people would know their prioritized tasks in their head, rather than depend upon the application for prioritizing those tasks in the background
- They may have neglected people who aren't as tech savvy and want a very basic (but still pleasant to look at) output from the app

For the competitors to do so, they would have to think more about what users they could reach with some possible additional features and changes.
