## How did you organize the team?

We want to make sure we are all contributing equally.
Thus when splitting up work for sprint 0 we decided which work was required to be done together and which could be done individually. For individual work we divided by mark allocation. 

For the upcoming sprints we plan to split work based on frontend and backend; 2 members on front, 2 members on back. However this is preliminary and if backend requires more work we will reallocate team members. 
We will decide roles based on preference. 

## Which tools did you use?
We use Discord to communicate and host our virtually meetings.
We use Trello to project manage and delegate tasks.
We use Google forms to vote when there are disagreements.

## How did you make decisions?
In general we follow unanimous decision making and fall back to majority rules if we can not all agree, however we are open to discussion. 

When choosing our project idea, we all brainstormed individually and brought our ideas to the team in our in-person meeting. 
We presented our pitches then voted on which one we thought was best. 

When choosing our tech stack, since we come from different levels of experience we let the more knowledgeable members select our tech stack.

## How did you define priority and/or points of user stories?
We created a Google Form which listed each of our user stories and has the ability for each member to rate it from 1-10. Then, we took the average rating of each one. 

## How frequently did you meet?
We met every Wednesday during lab from 11:30am - 2:30pm. Since, we have members from different lab sections our rule of thumb is come as early and stay as late as possible in that time slot. In addition to in-person we have virtual meeting usually on the weekends. We create a poll on Discord to find a non-conflicting time slot for all of us. Futhermore, we may have also have impromptu virtual meetings where not all members must attend. 

## What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
We should take meeting minutes because it is unavoidable that one of us may miss a meeting. 
Make use of git branches as things can get messy. Additionally, communicate clearly when making branches and pushing to main.
