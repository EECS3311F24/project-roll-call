# ROLLCALL SUMMARY

## Part 1: The Project Objective
Build an application that automatically generates a personalized daily roll-call report by syncing with the user's Google Calendar. The app aims to provide an overview of daily meetings, tasks, and priorities, helping users stay organized and informed without manual effort.

## Part 2: The Key Personas/Users
**Alex**—a mid-level manager at a large tech company, balancing multiple projects and meetings every day. Alex spends most of the day in back-to-back meetings and often struggles to prioritize tasks effectively. With little time for manual organization, Alex relies heavily on tools that can streamline scheduling and offer task prioritization to maintain focus throughout the day.

**Sara**—a graduate student juggling research, teaching assistant responsibilities, and coursework. Sara often has tight deadlines and a packed schedule with little time to reflect on upcoming priorities. Sara values tools that provide a quick snapshot of the day, help her stay organized, and remind her of key tasks and deadlines without overwhelming her.

**Rachel**—a busy parent of three school-aged children, managing not only her own schedule but also coordinating her kids' school activities, extracurricular events, and medical appointments. Rachel needs a tool that can aggregate multiple calendars, provide quick insights into everyone’s day, and suggest upcoming priorities so she can stay ahead of appointments and deadlines while balancing her work commitments.

## Part 3: The Key Scenarios
Alex, a mid-level manager, starts the day with six back-to-back meetings, and no time to manually plan out priorities. He opens the RollCall app, which has already synced with his Google Calendar. The app generates a summary showing his meeting schedule, the list of attendees, and flags the highest-priority tasks. It also suggests time slots where Alex can fit in preparation for upcoming meetings, helping him maintain focus despite the busy day ahead.

Sara, a graduate student, is facing a tight deadline for her thesis, while also balancing teaching assistant responsibilities. She opens the app in the morning to find a daily report showing her class schedules, grading deadlines, and a suggested to-do list prioritized by upcoming thesis deadlines and class reminders. This quick overview helps Sara manage her time more effectively, allowing her to switch between tasks with minimal stress.

Rachel, a parent of three, is juggling her kids' soccer practices, doctor's appointments, and school activities along with her own work schedule. The DailyBrief – RollCall app pulls in all the different calendars, providing a single snapshot of her and her children's schedules. The app suggests a plan to ensure all activities are covered, and Rachel receives reminders about her children’s important events like parent-teacher conferences and soccer games, helping her stay organized without missing any key appointments.

## Part 4: The Key Principles 
**User Simplicity over Feature Complexity**—The design should prioritize ease of use and clear, intuitive navigation over adding complex features. Users need to quickly understand and interact with the app to gain value from the daily summaries without feeling overwhelmed by too many options or settings.

**Personalization over Standardization**—The app should focus on tailoring the user experience to individual preferences. Whether it's task prioritization or calendar syncing, users should feel that the tool is customized to their needs, allowing them to adjust the roll-call report based on what matters most in their daily routines.
