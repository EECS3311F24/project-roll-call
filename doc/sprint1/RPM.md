# Release Planning Meeting:

### Attendees:
Karolina Tchilinguirova, Abhinaya Kondi, Christie Tang, Joshua Huliganga

### Release Goal: 
Roll Call will be able to automatically generate a daily roll-call or stand-up report based on an individual's Google Calendar. The app will summarize meetings, tasks, and suggest a personal TODO all without manual input.
Roll Call will be released in “Testing” because it will be utilizing Google Calendar API and in order for it to be published it must be submitted for verification.  Google application verification can take up 7 business days, and since we plan to develop up until release, publication is out of the scope for this project. 

A Google app in “Testing” means that only specified Test User’s Google accounts will have access to Roll Call. Therefore, in our release we will be able to Demo Roll Call on the mock google calendars of our 3 personas (Sara, Alex and Rachel).
